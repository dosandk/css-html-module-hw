        <p>About me: I have technical education (master's diploma in physics) and worked 2 decades in managerial positions in construction, logistics, and oil&gas industries. Since childhood I took interest in programming but it was at its early stage of development then that's why I didn't pursue it. However, I brought up two daughters who work in IT today, moreover, both of them at Eleks. They were the ones who urged me to rekindle my old fascination.</p>

      <p>desired position: Junior frontend developer</p>
      <p>About myself: I have tried many positions: assistant manager, tourism manager, call center operator and manager, deputy head of the post office, and others.
        Whenever possible, I try to learn something new and try to break away from office work to become a freelancer.
        A friend advised me to take a course at Eleks, for which I am very grateful to her!
        Also, at the moment, I'm studying video animation. At the moment I have no experience in IT. </p>
      <p>The IT course I'm studying now: JavaScript + HTML/CSS at ELEKS University</p>
      <ul>Course topics:
        <li>Git</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript and DOM API</li>
        <li>React</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After studying at Ivan Franko Lviv National University, I received the level of a specialist in socio-economic geography</p>
